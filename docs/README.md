## Introduction

LPG is a fuel gas used inÂ cooking appliances, and heating appliances. There were many issues with gas consumption in the most recent time period. The issues found as a whole are listed below.
* Available quantity of gas
* Gas leakage explosion
* Daily gas usage
* Consumption over the limit
* Struggle in easy refilling

## Conclusion

As a conclusion, the system we are creating guarantees that we will offer the capacity to,
* Measure the quantity of the remaining gas
* Give alert when a gas explosion is about to happen
* Provide analytics of daily, weekly and monthly usage
* Connect with the gas suppliers nearby by providing contacts
